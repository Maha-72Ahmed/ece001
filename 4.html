		<h1>A programming language is a formal language contains a set of instructions that produce various types of output. We use programming languages in computer programming to achieve algorithms. Most programming languages consist of the computer instructions. There are programmable machines which use a group of specific instructions instead of programming languages generally. Early ones preceded the invention of the digital computer, the first possibly being the automatic flute player described in the 9th century by the brothers Musa in Baghdad, during the Islamic Golden Age. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the action of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to various inputs or conditions. Thousands of different programming languages have been generated and more are being generated every year.</h1>
